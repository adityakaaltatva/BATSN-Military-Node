# BATSN - Bioengineered Anti-terror Surveillance Network

## Overview

**BATSN (Bioengineered Anti-terror Surveillance Network)** is a state-of-the-art surveillance system designed to enhance national security through the integration of biosensors and blockchain technology. The system focuses on real-time explosive detection and threat monitoring in sensitive areas, ensuring public safety through innovative, data-driven solutions.

This project utilizes a distributed ledger technology to maintain immutable records of detected threats, offering transparency, data integrity, and a scalable solution for various security needs.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: 24/7 surveillance through advanced biosensor technologies for constant detection of potential threats.
- **Threat Detection**: Precise identification and detection of explosives, with immediate alerts for any anomalies.
- **Blockchain Security**: Immutable logs stored on a blockchain, ensuring secure data and protecting against tampering.
- **Scalable**: Capable of being scaled to handle various levels of threat detection across different environments.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend UI for managing and visualizing system data.
- **Next.js**: Framework for building scalable web applications.
- **Blockchain (Ethereum/Smart Contracts)**: To maintain secure, immutable logs of threat alerts.
- **TailwindCSS**: For responsive design and seamless styling across all devices.
- **API Integration**: To fetch real-time system data (number of active sensors, alerts, threats, etc.).

## System Overview

The BATSN system encompasses several key metrics to evaluate its operation and efficiency. The system tracks:

- **Active Sensors**: Biosensors currently monitoring the environment.
- **Total Alerts**: Number of alerts triggered due to detected threats.
- **High Threats**: Critical level threats identified by the sensors.
- **Blockchain Logs**: Number of logs maintained within the blockchain network for data integrity.
